# Petros Andarige Project Links

Hi! I'm Peter. A recent graduate of Concordia University Texas. During my time being a high-achieving college student working with Java and Python, I received a 4-Year Excellence Scholarship as well as Deanâ€™s list Placement for all of college. I also have some experience working with sales as well as working in a capstone project centered around software development. During that time I developed solid collaboration, conflict resolution, and general group work skills. I am also able to manage tension between peers well while performing in team exercises and have a strong desire to contribute and carry my own weight when put into a group setting.
Here are a few Links to a few of the projects I've done.

This one is a Dice roller that can create named presets with modifiers. It was created with tabletop games in mind.

This is a proto lexical analyzer using recursive descent that I built in college to better understand how compilers work.
